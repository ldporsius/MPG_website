<p><strong>What data do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>Marks pattern generator is an app that lets you design patterns in a grid, useful in for example knitting or embroidery.
You can also download patterns from our online collections after which they are completely free to use by you in any way you see fit.
At this moment we do not offer the possibility to create an account. That may change in the future, to enable you to make use of the app across different devices.
When that will be the case, our policy will be as follows:</p>
<p><strong>How do we collect your data?</strong></p>
<p>Your email and name are collected at the moment you create an account. You have to provide this information so if you switch devices we can give you access to patterns you created or purchased.</p>
<p><strong>How will we use your data?</strong></p>
<p>We will never share your personal data with other parties.</p>
<p><strong>How do we store your data?</strong></p>
<p>At this moment no data is stored anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>What are your data protection rights?</strong></p>
